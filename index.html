        <div class="Wireframing">
            <h3>Wireframing</h3>
            <p>     It is always important when approaching any project to know who you are designing and understanding what they expect out of a product whether that is to deliver on what they want or to subvert their expectations.
                This is because it is the role of the UX designer to deliver and follow through on what is promised to the stakeholders. 
                This importance of wireframing leads to me focusing on the barebones layout of a project before moving on to the rest of the project as it is through this process that you are able to better incorporate other elements to the project later on.

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>     Much like how it is important to have a clear idea about having a clear idea about how things should look on the page when it comes to layout, branding is another aspect of design that is important to always be thinking about. This can be done through choosing what colors work best for the project you are working on, what should go into the logo of the project, and lastly and most importantly how do you make the project feel uniquely its own thing. 
                It is crucial to bring this up because as a designer and more importantly as someone who is trying to attract people to a product, you need to make yours stand out and be seen as something that is not like the other options out there.
